# Vue Localizer

I was quite enthusiastic about [Vue-i18n-translator](https://fka.dev/vue-i18n-translator/) but I felt confused when I tried to use it. I just could not figure out how to use it. It felt unfriendly to me. So I built a tool which serves my needs a little better. Hopefully, it will be useful for others, too - [demo](https://tmcdos.github.io/vue-localizer-gui/).

## Installation

In the usual way

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Running in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Notes

I have intentionally not implemented destructive operations like deleting or renaming - perhaps one day I will add these.
